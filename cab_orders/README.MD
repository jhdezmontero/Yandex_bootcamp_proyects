# Prediction of cab orders using time series

The company Sweet Lift taxi has collected historical data on cab orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the number of cab orders for the next hour using regression models based on time series.

## Project instructions

1. Download the data and resample for one hour.
2. Analyze the data
3. Train different models with different hyperparameters. The test sample should be 10% of the initial data set.4. Test the data using the test sample and provide a conclusion.

## Data Description
The data is stored in the `taxi.csv` file. 	
The number of orders is in the `num_orders` column.

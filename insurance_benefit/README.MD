# Machine Learning model for predicting insurance benefits

## Introduction

The insurance company Sure Tomorrow wants to solve several tasks with the help of machine learning and asks you to evaluate that possibility.

* Task 1: Find customers who are similar to the given customer. This will help the company's agents with marketing.
* Task 2: Predict the probability that a new customer will receive an insurance benefit. Can a trained model do better than a random model?
* Task 3: Predict the number of insurance benefits a new customer might receive using a linear regression model.
* Task 4: Develop a way to protect clients' personal data without affecting the model from the previous task.

A data transformation algorithm needs to be developed that makes it difficult to retrieve personal information if the data falls into the wrong hands. This is called data masking or data obfuscation. But data must be protected in such a way that the quality of machine learning models is not affected. It is not necessary to choose the best model, it is enough to demonstrate that the algorithm works correctly.
